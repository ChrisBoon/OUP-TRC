//the app uses angular bootstrap for functionality.
//rather than bloat the filesize with the entire bootstrap css I generally copy the required styles into the main codebase
//eg the 'modal' component is used so the css for it can be found in components/modal.scss
//this file is just a temporary store for when I first integrate an element.
